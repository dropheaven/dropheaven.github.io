  My first year in college I had decided that I wanted to major in Computer Science but when it came to signing up for classes I was bummed out that the college I was attending did not offer any Computer Science courses during the evening hours and due to my work schedule there was no way I could make it during the day. This led me to taking some Political Science courses which greatly interested me and here I am almost 3 years later as a junior majoring in Political Science. It was a tough decision to put this on hold but I think it’s best to acquire a skill that is in-demand and something that I can see myself doing for many years to come. 
  Don’t get me wrong, I don’t regret my time studying politics for it has helped me understand the ideas and historical events that helped shape and continues to shape important aspects of our societies. However, I do not see myself pursuing any careers related to my studies. On the other hand, going back to school to study Computer Science is not a viable option for me at this point in life, so when a friend told me about coding bootcamps I knew it was something I needed to look into.
  Fast forward to many months contemplating whether or not I should take the plunge I have finally decided that this is the right course for me. Using learning platforms such as Code School and Code Academy I was able to test out if coding was right for me and if I even enjoyed learning it. Luckily, the problem solving aspect really appeals to me and working out the labs here at Flatiron and problems on CodeWars is something I look forward to even though at times I want to launch my laptop across the room and rage quit when a solution is not working out, haha. All in all, I am excited to commit to learning all about web development here at Flatiron School.
