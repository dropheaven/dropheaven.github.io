For my Sinatra portfolio project I built a light web-app that tracks a user’s upcoming bills. This idea dawned on me a couple weeks ago when I made a late credit card payment due to forgetting a due date and thinking to myself that I need to put together a list of all bills and the dates they are due in one place, so this doesn’t occur again. Working my way through the Sinatra section I realized I could base my project off of this idea and so I did.

Getting the basic structure of the application down came fairly easy as the two previous labs helped get me familiar with how Sinatra apps are laid out. Afterwards, I wrote the migrations and the two models I’d be working with - User and Bill. A user has many bills and a bill belongs to a user. Working with only two models that related to each other in a basic fashion made building the routes and forms pretty straight forward. I was able to implement CRUD functionality without running into any roadblocks. But once I got done with the routes and I was left with an app that looked like a website from back in the 90’s and this is where I spend most of my time reviewing HTML and CSS.

I came across a great tutorial on Youtube that I will link below in which a responsive website is built from scratch. I ended up using much of the same layout from this user’s project and came away with a much better looking site than I had originally thought. Also this tutorial was a great refresher. 

Before starting on this project I wasn’t too fond with HTML or CSS because I have trouble visualizing how I want a website to look like in the very beginning of a project but towards the end of my Sinatra app I can see a shift in how I view front-end development. I think this is due to just getting my feet wet and building something from scratch which gave me a bit of confidence when it comes to tackling the HTML and CSS portion of a project. Overall I came away with a better understanding of how requests are handled by both the browser and application and how MVC architecture helps separates concerns into three main components. I look forward to building on the knowledge in the Rails section.
